### About the game

A few months ago, I discovered a small listing in Basic published in the n°38 of Jeux et Stratégie of April/May 1985. It is a little puzzle game which is a mix of Reverso and Othello. You have a game board with 16 two-coloured pawns forming a 4 x 4 square. The aim is to turn all the pieces over by following one rule: When you point at a piece, its 8 neighbours change colours but keep its own.

A few pages later, the magazine adapted the board game to Basic. Nothing great, today we would call it a game in "console mode".

In my version, the one I propose here, the 16 pawns are replaced by cards, but the principle is always the same: When you point to a card, its 8 neighbours are turned over except for it. Will you be able to turn them all over?
